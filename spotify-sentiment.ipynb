    "The goal of this project is to use the Spotify API and Spotipy to get the titles of the top 5 songs from Spotify's Top Songs Global playlist, along with several Top Songs playlists for specific countries. The LyricsGenius API will be used to get the lyrics for each track, then sentiment analysis will be performend on the data using spaCy. Song data will be saved in JSON files, then sentiment analysis will be done using spacy and spacy text blob. \n",
    "\n",
    "The playlists are updated weekly and were accessed on August 4-5, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Several of the songs in these playlists contain explicit lyrics. Proceed with caution.\n",
